# This module offers a mechanism to register and report issues to the user.
#
# It includes:
#
# * A set of classes to represent the issues ({Y2Issues::Issue},
#   {Y2Issues::InvalidValue}).
# * A class to collect errors ({Y2Issues::List}).
# * A presenter to help when presenting the issues to the user ({Y2Issues::Presenter}).
#
# @example Registering an error
#   list = Y2Issues::List.new
#   list << Y2Issues::Issue.new("Could not read network configuration", severity: :fatal)
module Y2Issues
  # Reports the errors to the user
  #
  # @see Y2Issues::Reporter
  def self.report(issues)
    Reporter.new(issues).report
