module Installation
  # An abstract class that simplifies writing `*_auto.rb` clients for AutoYaST.
  #
  # It provides a single entry point
  # which dispatches calls to the abstract methods that all proposal clients
  # need to implement.
  #
  # You need to implement all the methods, except {#packages}.
  #
  # "Autoinstall" basically means {#import}, then {#write}.
  #
  # The workflow for interactive editing in the UI
  # (`Mode.config == true`, see {Yast::ModeClass})
  # is more complicated. The user can choose to perform any action, and
  # a corresponding method is called:
  #
  # - {#summary}: clicking on the icon of the module.
  # - {#reset}: clicking Clear.
  # - if the user clicks to Edit a module, at first {#export} is called,
  #   then {#change} is called for UI interaction, which can end up
  #   in multiple situations:
  #   - if cancelled/aborted, {#import} is called (on the previous result of
  #     {#export})
  #   - otherwise {#export} is called. If the output is different from the
  #     previous call, then {#modified} is called.
  # - {#write}: clicking Apply to System.
  # - {#read}: clicking Clone.
  # - {#import}: selecting File/Open to load an autoyast profile
  # - it calls {#modified?} to recognize if a given module is modified and needs
  #   its section with content of {#export} when saving the profile
  # - the order of all calls is independent, so the client should not depend
  #   on a certain order unless it is defined here as a workflow call
  #
  #
  # @example how to run a client
  #   require "installation/example_auto"
  #   ::Installation::ExampleAuto.run
  #
  # @see https://github.com/yast/yast-bootloader/blob/master/src/clients/bootloader_auto.rb
  #   Example client, bootloader_auto.rb
