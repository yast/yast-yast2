module Installation
  # Abstract class that simplify writting finish clients for installation.
  # It provides single entry point and abstract methods, that all finish clients
  # need to implement.
  # @example how to run client
  #   require "installation/example_finish"
  #   ::Installation::ExampleFinish.run
  # @see for example client in installation clone_finish.rb
  #
  # # Inst-Finish Scripts
  # ## About
  # They are called by the inst_finish.ycp installation client at the end of the
  # first stage installation.
  #
  # Part of these clients are called with SCR connected to inst-sys, the others
  # are called after SCR gets switched to the installed system (chrooted).
  #
  # Script inst_finish.ycp contains several stages, every has
  #
  #   * label - visible in the writing progress
  #
  #   * steps - list of additional inst_finish scripts that are called
  #   ("bingo" -> "bingo_finish.ycp")
  #   Important script is "switch_scr", after that call, SCR is connected to the
  #   just installed system.
  #
  # ## Finish Scripts
  #
  # Every single finish script is a non-interactive script (write-only). It's
  # basically called twice:
  #
  #   * At first "Info" returns in which modes "Write" should be called
  #
  #   * Then "Write" should be called to do the job
