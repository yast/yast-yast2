module Yast
  # Progress popup dialog that only opens after a certain delay, so it never
  # opens for very short operations (< 4 seconds by default), only when an
  # operation takes long enough to actually give feedback to the user.
  #
  # This is less disruptive than a progress dialog that always opens, and in
  # most cases, flashes by so fast that the user can't recognize what it says.
  #
  # The tradeoff is that it takes a few seconds until there is any visual
  # feedback (until the delay is expired).
  #
  # Notice that this does not use an active timer; the calling application has
  # to trigger the check for the timeout by calling progress() in regular
  # intervals.
  #
  # You can change the delay by changing the delay_seconds member variable, you
  # can force the dialog to open with open!, and you can stop and (re-) start
  # the timer.
  #
  # In any case, when done with this progress reporting, call close(). You
  # don't need to check if it ever opened; close() does that automatically.
  #
  # see   examples/delayed_progress_1.rb  for a usage example.
