    # Class to configure a wizard layout
    #
    # There are four possible layouts:
    #
    # * With a left sidebar which is usually used to place the installation steps.
    # * With a left tree.
    # * Without a sidebar/tree and with the title of the dialogs on the left.
    # * Without a sidebar/tree and with the title of the dialogs on top.
    #
    # Moreover, for each layout, a top banner can be added.
    #
    # @example
    #   layout1 = UI::Wizards::Layout.with_steps
    #   layout2 = UI::Wizards::Layout.with_title_on_left
    #   layout3 = UI::Wizards::Layout.with_title_on_top
    #
    #   layout3.show_banner
    #
    #   layout1.open_wizard do
    #     # ...
