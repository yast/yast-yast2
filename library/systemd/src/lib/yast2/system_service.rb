module Yast2
  # This class represents a service from a high level point of view
  #
  # When talking about systemd, it might happen that a service could have an associated
  # socket (or path or timer). This class is able to group those units and offer an API
  # to handle them together.
  #
  # See also {file:library/systemd/doc/services_and_sockets.md}.
  #
  # @note All changes performed over an object of this class are not applied into the
  # underlying system until the {#save} method is called.
  #
  # @example Enabling a service
  #   cups = SystemService.find("cups")
  #   cups.start_mode = :on_boot
  #   cups.save
  #
  # @example Activating a service
  #   cups = SystemService.find("cups")
  #
  #   cups.currently_active? #=> false
  #   cups.active?           #=> false
  #
  #   cups.start
  #
  #   cups.currently_active? #=> false
  #   cups.active?           #=> true
  #
  #   cups.save
  #
  #   cups.currently_active? #=> true
  #   cups.active?           #=> true
  #
  # @example Changing start mode
  #   cups = SystemService.find("cups")
  #   cups.start_mode = :on_demand
  #
  #   cups.current_start_mode #=> :on_boot
  #   cups.start_mode         #=> :on_demand
  #
  #   cups.save
  #
  #   cups.current_start_mode #=> :on_demand
  #   cups.start_mode         #=> :on_demand
  #
  # @example Ignoring status changes (useful when changing the service on 1st stage)
  #   cups = SystemService.find("cups")
  #   cups.start
  #
  #   cups.currently_active? #=> false
  #   cups.active?           #=> true
  #
  #   cups.save(keep_state: true)
