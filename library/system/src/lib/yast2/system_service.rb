module Yast2
  # This class represents a system service
  #
  # When talking about systemd, it might happen that a service is compose by a set of units
  # (services, sockets, paths and so on). This class is able to group those units and
  # offer an API to handle them together.
  #
  # Additionally, this class does not modify the underlying system until the #save
  # method is called.
  #
  # @example Enabling a service
  #   cups = SystemService.find("cups")
  #   cups.start_mode = :boot
  #   cups.save
  #
  # @example Activating a service
  #   cups = SystemService.find("cups")
  #   cups.start
  #   cups.save
  #
  # @example Ignoring status changes on 1st stage
  #   cups = SystemService.find("cups")
  #   cups.start
  #   cups.save(ignore_status: true)
