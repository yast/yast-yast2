module Y2Packager
  # This class represents a libzypp URL
  #
  # Libzypp URLs do not conform to rfc3986 because they can include the so-called
  # Repository Variables. Those vars can have several formats like $variable,
  # ${variable}, ${variable-word} or ${variable+word}. According to libzypp's
  # documentation, the variables can appear in any component of the URL (host, path,
  # port...) except in scheme, user or password. But, at the time of writing, zypper
  # throws an "invalid port component" error when trying to use variables as part of
  # the port, even with the most recent available version of libzypp.
  #
  # See https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/libzypp/HEAD/zypp-repovars.html
  #
  # The current implementation relies on SimpleDelegator to expose all the methods
  # of an underlying URI object, so objects of this class can be used as a direct
  # replacement in places that used to use URI, like {Y2Packager::Repository#raw_url}

    # FIXME: escaping does not work here because the port wouldn't accept the escaped
    # characters either. If we really want to support the usage of repository variables
    # in the port, we would likely have to implement one of these solutions:
    #
    # 1) Modify the regexp used by URI to parse/validate the port, so it accepts the
    #    vars (escaped or not). That's not as easy as the documentation of the URI class
    #    suggests and may affect the reliability of the parsing.
    # 2) Extract the port section before parsing the URL if it contains repovars, storing
    #    its value in a separate instance variable and restoring it on demand.
    #
    # Anyways, using variables in the port of an URL doesn't seem to really work in libzypp,
    # although it's documented to be valid.

    # configuring the parser of URI to accept those characters. Done this way

    # which is not only risky but would also prevent us from benefiting from
    # future improvements in the Ruby's URI regexps.
