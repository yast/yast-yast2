      # Find a new available base product which upgrades the installed base product.
      #
      # The workflow to find the new base product is:
      #
      #  1) If there is only one available base product then just use it,
      #     there are no other options than to upgrade to this product.
      #
      #  2) TODO: Somehow evaluate the available and installed products and
      #     find the best upgrade candidate.
      #
      #     Note: We cannot use the solver here because it evaluates *all*
      #     packages, not just the products. Moreover some products
      #     (modules/extensions) might be added later which could change
      #     the best upgrade candidate.
      #
      #  3) Use a harcoded mapping with the list of installed products
      #     mapped to a new base product product. The static mapping is needed to
      #     handle some corner cases properly. This includes product renames or
      #     changing a module to a base product.
      #
      #  4) As the last attempt try to find the installed base product in the
      #     available base products. It is very likely that SLES will be upgraded
      #     to SLES, SLED to SLED and so on.
      #
      #  If no candidate product is found then it returns nil. That should happen
      #  only when using completely incompatible products.
