    #
    # A release note fetcher offers a mechanism to get release notes from a determined
    # source. If you want to define a new way of getting release notes for a given product,
    # you should define a class that inherits from this {Base} class and implements
    # its API.

    # @see Rpm
    # @see Url

      attr_reader :product
