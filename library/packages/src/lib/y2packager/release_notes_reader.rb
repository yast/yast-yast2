module Y2Packager
  # This class is able to read release notes for a given product
  #
  # It can use two different strategies or backends:
  #
  # * {ReleaseNotesFetchers::Rpm} which gets release notes from a package.
  # * {ReleaseNotesFetchers::Url} which gets release notes from an external URL
  #   (using the relnotes_url property from the given product).
  #
  # ### How it works
  #
  # We can distinguish two different case:
  #
  # * When the system *is registered*: release notes will be obtained from RPM packages.
  #   If release notes are not found there, it will fall back to the
  #   "relnotes_url" product property.  This behaviour covers the case in which
  #   you are installing behind a SMT but without access to Internet.
  # * When the system *is not registered*: it will work the other way around, trying
  #   first relnotes_url and falling back to RPM packages.
  #
  # ### Cached release notes
  #
  # Release notes are stored using an instance of `Y2Packager::ReleaseNotesStore`.
  # When trying to read a product release notes for second time, this class will try to fetch
  # the latest version (determined by ReleaseNotesFetchers::Rpm#latest_version or
  # ReleaseNotesFetchers::Url#latest_version from the store). If release notes are not there,
  # or the stored version is outdated (maybe a new package is now available), it will
  # try to get that version.
  #
  # Take into account that, when using the relnotes_url property, an URL that already
  # failed will not be retried again. See ReleaseNotesFetchers::Url for further details.
