# Package:	Network configuration
# Summary:	Init script handling, ifup vs NetworkManager
# Authors:	Martin Vidner <mvidner@suse.cz>
#
# This module used to switch between /etc/init.d/network providing
# LSB network.service and the NetworkManager.service (or another),
# which installs a network.service alias link.
#
# The service name installing the network.sevice is visible in the
# "Id" systemctl property:
#
#     # systemctl --no-pager -p Id show network.service
#     Id=network.service
#     # systemctl --force          enable NetworkManager.service
#     # systemctl --no-pager -p Id show network.service
#     Id=NetworkManager.service
#
# The network.service alias link obsoletes the old master switch in
# /etc/sysconfig/network/config:NETWORKMANAGER (until openSUSE-12.2).
