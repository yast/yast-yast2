 * Summary:
 *   SCR Agent for reading/writing the user-defined alias table
 * Authors:
 *   Martin Vidner <mvidner@suse.cz>
 * Access:
 *   read/write
 * See:
 *   yast2-config-mail/ag_mailtable.html
 *
 * An agent for a unified alias table.
 *
 * There are slight differences between MTAs in that Postfix does not
 * allow to escape a newline character to continue an entry, while
 * Sendmail does. We solve it by allowing the escape, because that
 * makes our syntax a larger language than the actual one, not
 * smaller.
 *
 * The file specifies a map, but we represent it as a list to preserve
 * preceding comments and the order of entries.
 * list entries are"
 *  $[ "comment": " foo\n bar\n", "key": "root", "value": "joe, \\root" ]
 *  that is, comments have the leading '#' stripped but not the newline.
 *
 * Example:
 *   Read (.mail.aliases.table)
